Not entirely sure what a neuter'd buffer is atm :/

IDA shows return value being an int

//Return Value Meaning
//Error Conditions


//Erroneous return values


//mandatory modifications

buffer.bytelength = 0
buffer.isneutered = true
buffer.viewlist = null

All views in the buffers viewlist also get neutered and set to length 0

//optional modifications

if (newContents.data() != buffer->dataPointer())
    buffer->setNewOwnedData(cx->runtime()->defaultFreeOp(), newContents);

//exceptions

OUT OF MEMORY EXCEPTION DOESNT HIT ANY OF THE MADNDATORY MODIFICATIONS

//Notes

Has a list of views it contains then calls neuter on each view to modify the data and keep the view in a consistent state

Overall has some decent state changing ability but I believe it is relatively safe. 
Need to see where it is called and how it is used due to the lack of return value

All mandatory modifications happen after success throughout the function so there is no way to
cause a state confusion problem with the flag updates
